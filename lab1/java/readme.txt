1) I see lines with numbers not being held together example: 1 0 0 0
DAY. I also see longer words but more unrealistic being found, example
aday instead of a day. I see capital letters that you can used to
parse words but the program is not realizing it, example BestS mell
s.

3)I put all numbers together. I tried to implement a hashMap but
cannot get the numbers to save in. If the hash map was working my code
would figure out where the greatest used word is in the string and
split on that one. I also tried to figure out if a lower case
character is followed by an upper case character and split there.
