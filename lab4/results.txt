1)58%
2)I count the positive words in the sentence and the negative words in
the sentence and then choose which is greater and lable it with the
greater one. 
3)Kamu ngedeketin mulu, jadi we salah tingkah si gue teh, sugan enya, pekteh modus si anjing, you know hell? Yes, i want you live in there!
I think hell is labled as negative 

I hafta admit, as a history nerd, I didn't much like the TurboTax
commercial #SuperBowlExp
I don't think this is positive

Guessed positive. must find positive words here

1) I used positiveWordCount *
(positiveWordCount/(positiveWordCount+negativeWordCount)) 
to normalize the counts and then choose the larger count and set the
other one to zero.

2) 48.75%

3)The fact that I don't learn many negative words

4) better programming skills, better math skills, better word lists,
better sentence organization.
