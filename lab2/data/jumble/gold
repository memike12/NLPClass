i am sending you the eol model on greg piper 's request 
the model reflects accurately the traded volumes on eol for 2000 
projections for 2001- 2011 were built based on feedback from traders investment bank and research institutes b2b forecasts and common sense 
these can be manipulated by changing the assumptions in the assumption sheet 
on the financial side the balance sheet and income statement have not been completely modelled since no specific deal structure has been defined 
though they include the main revenue and expense components for eol 
if you have any doubts with respect to the functionality of the model please let me know 
i am available to clarify them at your convenience 
wes expense the amortization to office of the chairman not west power or origination 
i try to run clean conservative books 
to that end i assessed every single originated transaciton when i took over the group in 1999 
edith cross and i turned over every rock that we could find booked things properly and moved on 
i know nothing about this amortization that 's been going on 
perhaps there were two payments to fort james one being the payment that west power trading expensed in 1997 associated with the in money wauna halsey position and the other associated with the overall alliance 
west power trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with wauna halsey in 1997 
i have the dpr from march of 1997 to prove it 
if this payment was capitalized for some reason after west power trading expensed it then i 'm not sure what to do 
it seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position twice 
if the amortization is associated with the second payment to fort james the alliance payment then we have a different kettle of fish entirely 
i don 't understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial group but when we do a one-time amortization of the balance it all of a sudden switches over to the west power trading group 
how come last month it was proper for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is proper for the charge to hit west power trading 
the charge should hit whoever 's rc it was who thought that paying fort james a bunch of money was a good idea 
if that person is no longer around the charge should either hit that person 's successor or it should hit a management book 
to your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal 
clearly it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a lot of uncertainty from the west power trading books 
having said that i have a hard time feeling good about the benefit that west power trading has received from these deals 
in 1999 i was told that this was largely a legal question 
a memo written by jake thomas on april 7 1999 memorializes this line of thought 
we established a 500k legal reserve rebooked the deals took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated with other old deals and granted the remainder about 1 million to jake in origination 
the entity that has benefited the most from these deals is west origination 
finally i can 't see how this expense belongs to west power trading 
i would like to understand how all of the accounting worked before i can accept an expense on my rc 
if you want to deal with the expense separately and have a discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then let 's do that 
that discussion needs to reflect history and include the origination that was granted in 1997 1999 and include the legal reserve of 500k 
give me a call when you get a chance 
tim my understanding is that partnership fee the 11.0m has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups mcconville and ondarza 
as you are aware i sued them for breach 
the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts 
it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop 
the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated 
it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of 1.8m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability 
edith cross and i looked at the fort james deal in great detail in early 1999 
when the deal was closed west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about 11 million 
this money has already liquidated from our book 
in fact i have a copy of the 3 31 97 dpr that reflects this liquidation 
at that time west power trading also paid a 350k credit reserve 247k to the finance book and 1.3 million in origination 
i have also heard about a partnership fee that enron paid to fort james around the same time 
i 'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it 
it had nothing to do with the west power trading book 
on john 's recommendation i called wes to see if we could figure this out 
wes please give me a call back to discuss 
i think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from march of 1997 to see why an expense of 11 million was deferred 
this is not my problem 
i should not receive this expense 
until this is resolved i would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power trading 's expenses 
donnie for july adjust the clinton volume to match the purchases from phillips and power gas marketing do not send out an invoice adjustment 
i may need to change the price on the sale to clinton so that our receivables are netting to 0 
for august september october and november make the clinton volumes match the phillips and power gas marketing supply and do send an invoice adjustment to clinton 
paul let me know if you have questions 
for july the imbalance is actually in ces 's pool and i have no idea how to adjust that 
for august forward i believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in clinton 's pool 
let me know if you want to make any price adjustments knock a nickel off the price i just want these deals to go away 
oh yeah and make clinton a lot of money 
do we know yet how we are going to handle this problem 
wade for july and august give me the actual volumes and price for phillips and power gas marketing behind peoples 
and are these volumes mcf 's or mmbtu 's 
and do we back out any gathering charges on this gas 
chris this buy sell deal with phillips seller and clinton buyer is causing some problems for these guys in settlements 
wade is paying by mcf 's so when i change the volumes for phillips it of course effects donnie 's volumes for clinton 
should this not be done as a buy sell or what should we do about this 
i will be out of the office tomorrow but back on monday 
donnie is needing an answer on this soon 
so far it looks like 07 00 and 08 00 
we just were informed that as per request of their ceo occidental has scheduled a media interview with reuters in approximately one hour publicizing that the company has been short listed and signed a letter of intent to participate in saudi arabia 's recent energy initiative 
john has asked me to forward oxy 's planned statement as well as our planned response to possible media inquiries resulting from this see attachments 
he does not anticipate any problems with the document and he recommends that we should allow oxy to include enron in the statement 
i received legal approval on both statements and we are currently securing approval from global markets 
katrina this is what i would propose saying to the media 
occidental is pleased to have made the short list of companies invited to submit letters of intent to develop the kingdom 's natural gas reserves 
occidental has been invited to submit proposals of 2 of the 3 ventures approved by the government 
occidental and our partner enron have signed a letters of intent and submitted them to the kingdom 
the government of the kingdom is to be commended for the exceptionally professional manner in which they have managed this process and the many courtesies they have extended the participants 
the government has laid a strong foundation for the development an excellent working relationship with private foreign investors in the energy sector who will be working in partnership with the kingdom in future years 
in the event we will receive any media inquires related to this matter i have prepared the following statement 
we can confirm that in partnership with occidental we have been short listed and we have signed a letter of intent to pursue future gas opportunities in the kingdom of saudi arabia 
we are pleased to have the opportunity to work with the kingdom of saudi arabia however it would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time 
i apologize for the short time frame but please let me know if you have any objections or concerns regarding this matter 
as a company working to emerge from bankruptcy enron looks and feels completely different 
however one thing is the same we continue to move and change at a fast pace 
last week we shared with you a developing management team 
this week we want to update you on some further management changes that have taken shape 
jim derrick executive vice president and general counsel will retire from enron effective march 1 2002 
rob walls currently deputy general counsel will succeed derrick and serve immediately as acting general counsel 
we are also happy to announce that mike mcconnell formerly ceo of enron global markets is returning to the company to help identify and develop business opportunities within our remaining non-regulated businesses 
we will continue to share changes to the management team as they occur 
kim here 's what you have to deal with at mesa 
i 'm gonna make one more run at this and she 's alllllll yours 
maybe we should meet in az some time in feb we can go see jan hutchens etc 
does tucson have any power shorts 
we 're trying to sell a toll on lv-ii and i thought they might be interested if they are short 
i am out of the office almost all day today however i wanted to let you know i had a brief chat with dave plumb 
at this point he does not think enron is offering us a good deal mostly because the -.30 is only on the half load and not the total and originally in deal one it was on the full load 
he did like that the 4.25 had come down to 4.14 
i was set back a little by his next remark which was there is no hurry because i want to take this to the utilities committee of council and they don 't meet until next week 
i told him the numbers would change significantly if we waited until february 
again he replied jan i want to take this to the utilities committee anyway 
he also indicated about working within a range 
so probably tomorrow i will put the pencil to the paper and try to make something presentable for him to take to the utilities committee 
it will have to be in layman 's terms and easy to follow numbers because these guys don 't deal in this every day 
i am a little miffed that he thinks and wants to go to the committee first 
we have never done that before 
usually we just get a deal worked up present it in an affirmative manner to the city manager and he buys off on it 
so we will see he is the boss 
i am telling you all of this because i will probably be asking for your help to make this in a presentable manner 
talk to you later today or tomorrow for sure 
i am in the office all day thursday
